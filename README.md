## About The Project
As a student at the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA), I would like to make it easier for students to review and share their thoughts on their professors. I used this idea in my UTA object-oriented software engineering course. The app, however, was designed exclusively for Android devices. There are many students who aren't included in this demographic. It would be more beneficial if the students could gain access to this resource through a website they can access on their mobile devices, laptops, or their PCs.

Since I'm a student myself, I value professor reviews since it can make or break one's academic career. The character limit of other websites, such as [RateMyProfessors](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/), makes it difficult for students to really explain their experiences. Because of that, this project promises to offer students at UTA an in-depth review tool through verified student accounts without ads or monetary incentives.

Moreover, my role as a contributor to this project provides a great opportunity for me to learn and grow.

# License
To better serve the community, this project encourages others to add on and improve the tool. However, we wish to keep the project and all future projects derived from it free of any monetary incentive. A few of these practices include exposing users to intrusive advertisements and selling their personal information to third parties. It is important for the tool to be focused on what is important, which is helping students write and view reviews for their professors.
